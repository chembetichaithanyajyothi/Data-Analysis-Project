Project Insights:
-By doing Volatility analysis for closing price, the price fluctuation is more in NFLX and MSFT tricker group as compared to AAPL and GOOG.
-By doing Comparitive analysis for closing price, there is positive change to AAPL, NFLX, MSFT tricker groups but there is negative change to GOOG tricker group.
-AAPL shows the lowest risk combined with a positive average daily return, suggesting a more stable investment with consistent returns.
- GOOG has higher volatility than AAPL and, on average, a slightly negative daily return, indicating a riskier and less rewarding investment during this period.
-MSFT shows moderate risk with the highest average daily return, suggesting a potentially more rewarding investment, although with higher volatility compared to AAPL.
-NFLX shows moderate risk with higher volatility.

Final Conclusion:
-Understanding the market trends and behaviour by doing some required statistical calculations will lead to mitigate the risk with a great portfolio.
